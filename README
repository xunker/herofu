 = Herofu - a simple file server made for Heroku - http://herofu.heroku.com =
 ============================================================================

Herofu is a sinatra/rack app that is designed to be an easily deployed static
file server for Heroku's zero-provisioning app hosting server.  Files are
stored in database and are served in expected URL formats like
"http://appname.heroku.com/files/file.html".

Even though Herofu is designed for Heroku, it is nothing more than a rack-
deployed sinatra app and cane be used anywhere sinatra can run with database
access.

For local deployments (e.g. development environment) the mysql driver is
used and on heroku deployments ('production') the postgres driver is used.
Database tables are created automatically if they do not exist via an
ActiveRecord Migration.  Files are stored using ActiveRecord's :binary type
which is a 'bytea' on postges or a 'BLOB' on mysql.

Database configuration lives in config/database.yml should you want to change
it.

 ==============================
 = DEPLOYING HEROFU ON HEROKU =
 ==============================

1) You'll need a git-clone of the code with a command like:

	"git clone git@github.com:xunker/herofu.git".
	
	That will create a new directory named 'herofu' with some files in it.
	
2) Go to this new directory and edit herofu.rb.  Change the APPNAME, USERNAME
	and PASSWORD lines.  APPNAME will be the subdomain this will live under.

3) Commit those changes: 'git commit -a -m "initial config"'.
	
4) Get a Heroku account.  Get one at http://heroku.com/.

5) Install the Heroku gem installed on the machine you performed the git-clone
	on: "sudo gem install heroku".

6) Tell Heroku to make you a new app: "heroku create <APPNAME>" where APPNAME
	is the same as the APPNAME line in herofu.rb.

7) Deploy the app with git "git push heroku master".

PROFIT!!) Visit http://APPNAME.heroku.com/admin to see if it worked.

 ==========================================
 = USING HEROFU TO UPLOAD AND SERVE FILES =
 ==========================================

Assuming the deployment worked, go to  http://APPNAME.heroku.com/admin and
log in using the USERNAME and PASSWORD you set in herofu.rb.

You should see "0 files stored" as well as a form with a file selection box
and a text box.  Click the 'browse' button on the file box and choose a file
to upload.  Optionally, choose the location of this file in herofu with the
other text box.  Click 'upload'

The File should appear in the list below '1 files stored'.

Clicking the filename link will take you to the file in question in a new
window.  This file can now be seen by the world.

 =============================
 = RENAMING AND MOVING FILES =
 =============================

You can change where the file lives in the herofu app by clicking the 'edit'
link next to a file.  In the next page, you can change the filename and path
with the text box provided.  There are no real directories in herofu, so to
place a file in a 'subdirectory' prefix the filename with '/dirname/".

 ==================
 = DELETING FILES =
 ==================

On the main 'admin' page, click the 'delete' link next to a file.
